### Introduction

Vrtigo collects and processes metrics in VR-enabled applications. The
`vrtigo-reactvr` package allows developers to integrate Vrtigo into
their React VR applications, specifically applications that display
360 video environments. 

### Data Collection

All data collection and submission are controlled by the Vrtigo API
functions in the table below.  The `start`, `unpause`, `seekEnd`, and
`bufferEnd` functions all require an integer representing the relative
play position of the video in milliseconds (`positionMillis`). 

The `start` function, called when a video initially starts playing,
additionally requires a string indicating the video being viewed
(`videoId`).

It is important to instrument any event where the playback time
changes in the video, such as buffering and seeking/scrubbing, so that
the analytics are in sync with the viewerâ€™s behavior.

### Data Submission

You control when to submit data to Vrtigo. To submit data after
collection has been stopped with the stop function, simply call the
submit function. *Important: call submit after calling stop and before
calling start again.* The submit function returns a Promise object, so
be sure to `catch` any potential errors when calling it.
